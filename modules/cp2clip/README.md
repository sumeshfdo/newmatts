## INTRODUCTION

The Copy to Clipboard module is a tiny module that allows a copy to
clipboard capability by simply adding a class "cp-to-clip" to any block or
inline HTML element.
e.g. <div class="cp-to-clip"> Text ....</div>

The module attaches a javascript file with no dependencies and a css file to
every page, which add a "copy" button to the end of the text. Clicking the
button, or the text, copies the text to the clipboard.

The primary use case for this module is:

adding a class "cp-to-clip" to the HTML tag that encloses the text.
